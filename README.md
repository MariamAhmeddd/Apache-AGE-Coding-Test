## Second Problem :
To implement the given piecewise recurrence relation F(n) = F(n-3) + F(n-2), where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(2) = 2, there are three different approaches we can take:
# Recursive Approach:

# Dynamic Programming (Top-down) Approach using Memoization:

# Dynamic Programming (Bottom-up) Approach using Tabulation:
